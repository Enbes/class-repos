'Epsilon'* always returns true, and I was unable to find a way to make it reject certain input
	as all my attempts resulted in infinite loops.

'Epsilon''Epsilon' is used in one of my test cases and doesn't return true probably due to how I handle Concat, 	but in hindsight I'm uncertain if the expression even really makes sense.
